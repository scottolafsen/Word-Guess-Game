# word-guess-game2
* The premise of this game is to take a keydown event code and run it through a for loop to see if it matches a letter in the word that is being guessed. if you guess a word correctly you will get to see an image and paragraph that corresponds to the word. If you run out of wrong guesses on a word the "prize" will not be revealed and the next word will run.
